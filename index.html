<h1>Cheap apartment and car rental in Flic en Flac</h1>

325 Morcellement Palmyre<br/>
Flic en Flac 90514<br/>
Mauritius<br/>
</address>
<p>
Your home in Mauritius,
this two bedroom, one bathroom apartment is well-furnished and completely
equipped.
All rooms are on the first floor, above a similar apartment.
Double doors open to a wonderful terrace with great views of the
Indian Ocean to the West.
At the East end of the open floor plan,
there is a door to the stairs and the cane fields behind the building.
</p>
<p>
The building is located in a subdivision of Flic en Flac.
This subdivision ("<i>morcellement</i>") named "Palmyre", is on the East edge
of Flic en Flac, with cane fields to the East and the Indian Ocean to
the West.
All of the lots were purchased many years ago.
People build houses when they have saved up enough money;
mortgages are rarely taken to fund construction.
This explains why fewer than half of the lots have homes,
and why some of the homes are only partly built,
with the owners waiting to save more money before continuing to build.
</p>
<h2>Views of the outdoors</h2>
<p>
<p>Here are some views as seen from the residence.</p>
